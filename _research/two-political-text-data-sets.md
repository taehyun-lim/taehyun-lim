title: 'South Korean Party Statements and Individual Manifesto Corpora: Two Political Text Data Sets'
---



This paper introduces two text datasets from South Korean politics: The South Korean Party Statements Corpus and the South Korean Individual Manifesto Corpus. The South Korean Party Statements Corpus is a collection of official statements from the two major parties in South Korea from 2003 to 20182020. The South Korean Individual Manifesto Corpus is a collection of manifesto pamphlets of individual candidates who ran for offices in single-member districts. The paper first introduces the collection method for each data set. The text data are collected from the party’s official websites and National Election Commission’s official website. The texts for individual manifestos are extracted from PDF files using an automated text extraction method, Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The texts for both data sets are parsed using the khaiii python library. The individual manifesto dataset spans from 2000 to 2020 over eleven national and local elections, while the party statement dataset spans from 2003 to 2018. Being the primary campaign material in South Korean elections and everyday statements of major parties, the dataset will provide a novel opportunity for researchers to analyze inter-party and intra-party variation on political agenda and position. The paper further provides examples from each data set using environmental issues.
