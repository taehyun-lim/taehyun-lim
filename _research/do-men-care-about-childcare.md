title: Do Men Care about Childcare? Rethinking the Politics of Work-Family Reconciliation
---

with Margarita Estévez-Abe

We challenge the common assumption in the welfare state literature that: women’sgreater educational attainment and stronger labor market attachment have changed theirpreferences for work-family reconciliation policies–but not men’s. We demonstrate that in-dividuals consider household as an economic unit. Men in dual-earner households are oftenvery supportive of policies that subsidize their costs: subsidies for childcare and paid parentalleaves. We use international survey data to analyze factors that shape respondents’ prefer-ences for different reconciliation policies from nineteen OECD member countries, including South Korea.
