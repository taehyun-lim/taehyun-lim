title: 'Contextualizing Politics of the New Welfare State: Childcare and Basic Pension
  Development in South Korea (Dissertation)'
---

My dissertation, entitled Contextualizing Politics of the New Welfare State: Childcare and Basic Pension Development in South Korea, is about the South Korean welfare state development. In spite of the absence of those causal factors typically associated with generous welfare states, South Korea expanded its public childcare subsidies so much so rapidly that it became one of the top providers of formal childcare among OECD countries. What explains the recent welfare state expansion in Korea? And can the Korean case enrich our thinking about the politics of welfare expansion more broadly? These questions motivate my dissertation. 

I argue that the existing literature on the politics of work-family reconciliation policies largely fails to account for the South Korean case. My dissertation hence develops an alternative account--a contextually sensitive theory of party competition. I emphasize three contextual factors: (i) winner-takes-all electoral rules; (ii) rules about the timing of elections; and (iii) the role of the media. Winner-takes-all electoral rules incentivize political parties to focus on those policy issues that are popular in swing districts. If local elections take place on separate dates with national-level elections, parties learn about which issues resonate with voters in critical swing districts. Media coverage plays an important role in pushing some issues to the fore of the national debate. A combination of these conditions, I argue, can prompt party competition over the ownership of popular issues consequently leading to big policy shifts even when the causal factors considered in the literature as responsible for social policy expansions are absent.

I employ multiple methods to substantiate my arguments attesting to my openness to diverse approaches. I spent a total of seven months conducting fieldwork in South Korea and collected data from archives and interviewed key decision-makers--members of the National Assembly, party officials, academics, and government officials. I use two original data sets of large text corpora that I constructed by collecting them from the internet using a program I built. Lastly, I use existing survey data sets, cross-sectional and panel, to analyze public agenda and opinion.
