title: 'Contextualizing Politics of the New Welfare State: Family Policy Development in South Korea (Dissertation)'
---

My dissertation is about the South Korea's adoption of universal family policies  from 2009 to 2013. Despite the absence of those causal factors typically associated with generous welfare states, South Korea expanded its public childcare subsidies so much so rapidly that it became one of the top providers of formal childcare among OECD countries by 2013. What explains the recent welfare state expansion in Korea? And can the Korean case enrich our thinking about the politics of welfare expansion more broadly? These questions motivate my dissertation.

While being a single country study on South Korea, my dissertation directly engages with recent debates in comparative welfare state studies. I argue that the existing literature on the politics of work-family reconciliation policies largely fails to account for the South Korean case. My dissertation hence develops an alternative account–a contextually sensitive theory of party competition. I emphasize three contextual factors: (i) winner-takes-all electoral rules; (ii) rules about the timing of elections; and (iii) the role of the media. Winner-takes-all electoral systems incentivize political parties to focus on those policy issues that are popular in swing districts. If local elections take place on separate dates with national-level ones, parties learn about which issues resonate with voters in critical swing districts. Media coverage plays a pivotal role in pushing some issues to the fore of the national debate. A combination of these conditions, I argue, can prompt party competition over the ownership of popular issues, consequently leading to dramatic policy shifts even when the causal factors considered in the literature as responsible for social policy expansions are absent.

I employ multiple methods—such as process tracing, text analysis, panel data analysis, and causal inferences—to substantiate my arguments, attesting to my rigorous methodological training. I spent a total of seven months conducting fieldwork in South Korea and collected data from archives and interviews. I use two original data sets of large text corpora, which I collected from the internet using a program I built. Lastly, I use existing survey data sets, cross-sectional and panel, to analyze public agenda and opinion.
