Kim, D. H., **Lim, T. H.**, Hwang, Y. J., & Kim, S. 2023. _Journal of Health Communication_. [https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2023.2236963](https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2023.2236963)

The current study establishes emotional pathways to support for COVID-19 policies and social distancing behavior. While prior scholarship on preventive health behaviors has focused on identifying their cognitive predictors, emerging literature suggests that emotion may also be an important determinant of health behaviors. Drawing from appraisal theory and the discrete-emotions models of affect, the current study establishes emotional pathways to support for COVID-19 policies and social distancing behavior. Analyses of survey data collected in the U.S. and South Korea demonstrate that negative emotion experienced following partisan media use increases support for COVID-19 policies and social distancing behavior. Particularly, fear and anxiety toward the pandemic emerged as strong mediators in both countries while sadness also mediated the pathways in the U.S.
