title: Saving Democracy? Lukewarm Incumbent Voters and Fate of Executive Aggrandizement
  inSouth Korea and Turkey
---

with Aykut Özturk

We compare a success (Turkey) and a failure (SouthKorea) of democratic erosion.  South Korea recently suffered from executive aggrandizement,where President Park attempted to dismantle democratic institutions, which resulted in herbeing  impeached.   Turkish  President  Erdogan  succeeded  in  institutionalizing  aggrandizedexecutive  power  through  constitutional  amendment.   We  explain  the  divergent  outcomesbetween these two cases in terms of the relative strength of voters’ affective attachments tothe ruling party.  We demonstrate that, among the voters who voted for the ruling party inprevious elections, those with lukewarm affective ties to the party were more likely to defectdue to concerns of executive aggrandizement,  compared to voters having similar concernsbut stronger affective ties.
