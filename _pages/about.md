Welcome! I am a Data Science/Analysis Research Librarian at Hamilton College. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science in May 2023 and M.A. in Economics in May 2019 from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.

I am interested in utilizing data science methods to tackle research questions in diverse areas. My research focuses on public policy, public opinion, and political institution nexus. 

For details about me, my research, teaching, and data sets, check out the tabs above. You can also email me at [tlim@hamilton.edu](mailto:tlim@hamilton.edu).

Thanks for visiting!
