Course Description
======
International relations in its narrowest sense is the study of the relationships between and among the countries of the world. More recently, however, the field of IR has recognized the important influence of other international actors such as non-governmental organizations (like Amnesty International), international governmental organizations (like the United Nations), citizen movements, and multinational corporations (MNCs). In this introduction to international relations we will consider both state and non-state actors and work towards an understanding of the complexities of the conflict and cooperation that occurs in the international political arena. We will explore the many ways in which people think about and approach international relations, considering varying views of what constitute the major problems facing the world today, and the desirable and realistic solutions to those problems. Ideally this course will both educate you about the field of international relations, as well as help you develop your own views about what the most important international challenges are and what might be desirable outcomes.       

Course Learning Outcomes – Students will gain knowledge in the following areas:

* The process of globalization that is drawing countries, cultures, and international actors into closer relationship to one another, and the nature of those relationships and processes
* Three major topical perspectives: world institutional structure and theoretical views of that structure; international political economy; and international conflict, cooperation and security.
* The role and impact of both state and non-state actors
* Major international topics including: IR theories; foreign policy; international conflict of various kinds and conflict resolution; international organizations, law and human rights; international integration, both historically and currently; environmental and population challenges; the North-* South gap; and the international political economy

My Responsibility
======
I was the instructor for two recitation sections each semester. In Spring 2016, they were both twenty-eight students, in Fall 2016, twenty and twenty-one, and in Fall 2017, twenty three and twenty. I designed quizzes, graded exams, quizzes, and group projects, led two discussion sections every week, and held office hours.    

At first it didn’t come as easy as I hoped. Some students would be very eager to participate while others were passive and needed more encouragement. Some grasped my point quickly while others needed more explanation. I tried to listen better and be clearer as the sections went on. I was able to better attend to the students’ needs later on.
